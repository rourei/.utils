# Utility Scripts

This repository contains various utility scripts for different purposes.
This includes setting up a new Linux installation, managing shared aliases and repositories,
formatting bash script output and many more. 

Ideally, all of the scripts should provide a small help function that briefly explain usage and
purpose of the script.
